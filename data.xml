  <description>We're a small studio making big games. With a focus on social and cooperative game design, we're focused on building the types of places that people want to inhabit, not just play in. We think now is the time to change the culture of game development, by making everyone equals, not just in their impact on a project, but in how we divide the rewards from our success.</description>

  <history>Our co-founders have been thinking about social gaming for a long time. Chet was the lead on Left 4 Dead, Left 4 Dead 2, and Portal 2 at Valve and Kimberly is a co-founder of the Fairplay Alliance. In 2018, their shared interests collided during a fateful conversation in 2018. Building on their shared love of co-op games, they assembled a team to build both a new kind of cooperative shooter and a new kind of cooperative studio. That is Stray Bombay.</history>
