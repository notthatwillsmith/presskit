  <description>
We're a small studio making big games. With a focus on social and cooperative game design, we're building the types of places that people want to inhabit, not just play in. We think now is the time to change the culture of game development, by making everyone equals, not just in their impact on a project, but in how we divide the rewards from our success.

<history>Founded by Chet Faliszek and Dr. Kimberly Voll in 2019, Stray Bombay's driving  goal is to build better co-operative games. They built a different kind of studio to do just that. Chet was a writer on various games at Valve, including Portal 2, and the lead on Left 4 Dead 1 &amp; 2. Kimberly has a PhD in AI design and is a co-founder of the Fairplay Alliance. In 2018, they assembled a team to build both a new kind of cooperative shooter and a new kind of cooperative studio. That is Stray Bombay.</history>
